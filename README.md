Module 12 Challenge

Part One - was fairly straight forward. I used the acitivites from class to complete the project. The portion I had most trouble with is converting RatingValue to integer, I looked online for this solution, but the result (dict) is not what I expected.

I was finaly able to correct the issue that I had with converting RatingValue to integer and was able to complete the rest of the assignment.
